    <h2> The Cabot trail</h2>
    <h4>Cycling</h4>
    <p> Cycle Nova Scotia calls the Cabot Trail a challenging road ride carved into the edge of the stunning Cape Breton Highlands. With more than 3,400 m of climbing, its 300 km are most often ridden in two to three days. Still, Strava shows many cyclists who have tackled the double-century distance in as little as 12 hours. </p>

    <h2> Rockwall trail in Kootenay National Park</h2>
    <h4>Hiking</h4>
    <p>The Rockwall is unique in that its trailheads, the Floe Lake Trailhead and the Point Pots Trailhead, are 6.2 miles (10 km) apart so it’s easy enough to sort out the car shuttle. Mentally, it’s best to organize your car shuttle at the start of the trip so that you are heading towards your car, and not arriving late, sweaty and trying to hitchhike. Having a bike stashed can also work well. You can be friendly with other hikers and maybe they are doing it the reverse way and need to drop a car at the opposite end. </p>

    <h2><span> Barkley Sound Diving</span></h2>
    <h4>Scuba Diving</h4>
    <p>The Barkley Sound is world-renown for it's incredible diving conditions. In fact, the National Geographic Magazine recognized Vancouver Island as one of the best cold-water diving destinations in the world. People travel from around the world to explore famous wrecks in these waters.Scuba diving in BC (British Columbia) on the west coast of Vancouver Island in Canada is a spectacular and unique experience. Since 1973 great encounters with wolf-eels, giant Pacific octopus, sea lions, six gill sharks and much more have been our trademark. Combine this with great home made meals, whale and wild life viewing options and amenities such as a hot tub on the viewing deck, kayaks, a dedicated camera / classroom and you can see why we are one of the premier dive charter operators and a prime dive destination in Canada.</p>
