    <h2>3. Canadian war museum</h2>
    <p>Canada’s sacrifices and contributions to the South African and First World Wars led to an increased sense of nationhood and to international recognition. However, the strain of war nearly tore the country apart. In this gallery, visitors enter an imperialistic setting marking the 1897 Diamond Jubilee. Canada was proud to be part of the British Empire and celebrated in its greatness. Despite intense debates over whether to support Britain’s war in South Africa, Canada sent an overseas force. This decision marked an important change in Canadian military relations: Canada was now willing and able to support its allies by fighting in other countries. </p>
