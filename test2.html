            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p class="text">Canadian history has wars and revolutions, but also a lot of politics and economics. The country wasn’t created to be a home for any particular race or religious group, but instead a project to create a peaceful, orderly, well-governed society amid harsh geography and a diverse population.</p>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p class="text">Canada is divided into 13 self-governing units known as provinces and territories. In casual conversation, it’s also common to talk of Canada as being split into around six “regions;” large geographic zones that share various things in common, including climate, landscape, industry, demographics, and politics.</p>

              <h1>Weather in Canada</h1>
              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p class="text">Weather is a controversial topic with Canadians, born from a mix of frustration and defensiveness. On one hand, Canada is, undeniably, one of the coldest countries in the world, with temperatures in many cities dipping below -20°(C) in the winter (December-March), complete with heavy snowfalls, icy winds, and slippery, frozen streets. On the other hand, winter is only one of the country’s four seasons, and most inhabited parts of Canada also enjoy relatively mild autumns (September-December), pleasant springs (March-June), and warm summers (June-September). The common assumption of foreigners that Canada suffers through harsh cold all year round is a stereotype Canadians find irritating.</p>
