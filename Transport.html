      <h3>Public transportation (public transit)</h3>
        <ul>All cities and most major towns in Canada have a public transportation system with one or more ways to travel, such as:
          <li>bus</li>
          <li>train</li>
          <li>subway</li>
          <li>light-rail trains</li>
          <li>streetcars</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you plan to use public transportation, research your options before you decide where to live.
        <br><br>
        The bus is the most common form of urban transportation in Canada. Some cities have other modes of public transit. In most cases, you can easily transfer from one mode of transportation to another.
        <br><br>  
        To use public transportation, you must buy a ticket or a transit pass. Transit passes give you unlimited use of public transportation for a certain period (one month or more). They are usually cheaper than buying many tickets if you plan to use public transportation often.
        </p>
        <ul>In most cities, you can buy tickets at:
          <li>convenience stores</li>
          <li>major transit stations</li>
          <li>from the bus driver (you’ll need to give the exact amount)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>You can find out more about public transportation in your city or town by:
          <li>calling a transit information line</li>
          <li>visiting the website of your city government</li>
          <li>visiting an information kiosk at a main transit station</li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Air</h3>
        <p>Due to Canada’s large size, people often travel between major cities by airplane.
        <br>  
        All main cities have airports with regularly scheduled flights to and from many places. Some places don’t have a main airport, such as small towns or rural areas.</p>  
        <ul>If you’re travelling to a place without an airport you’ll need to:
          <li>fly to the nearest main airport</li>
          <li>rent a car or take a train or bus to your final stop</li>
        </ul>  
        <ul>To fly in Canada, you need:
          <li>a piece of photo identification issued by the federal, provincial or territorial government in Canada, or</li>
          <li>a foreign passport</li>

      <h3>Ferry</h3>
        <p>In coastal areas of Canada such as British Columbia and the Atlantic region, ferry boats are a common way to travel. Many ferries transport both passengers and vehicles.
         You can find out more and buy tickets from ferry companies that operate routes in your area.</p>
