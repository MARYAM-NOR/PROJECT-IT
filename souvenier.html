            <img src="large.jfif">
            <button>Crown Royal is the most popular whiskey in Canada. The reason behind the eloquent name is that it was specially made for the
                first trip of King George IV and Queen Elizabeth of England to Canada back in 1939</button>

        <h2>Best Places For Shopping in Canada</h2>

        <div class="item">
            <h4>1. Yorkville, Toronto, Ontario</h4>
            <img src="yorkville.jpg">
            <button>A quiet neighbourhood of small streets sheltered from the overall noise and hubbub of downtown Toronto, Yorkville is arguably Canada’s poshest shopping district-store rent tops $300 per square foot, and those little streets are home to some of the biggest names in fashion and design, including Burberry, Prada, Hugo Boss and Louis Vuitton and Tiffany & Co.
                 (not to mention dealerships for Rolls Royce and Maserati). Bring a credit card-or three.</button>
            </div>

        <div class="item">
            <h4>2. West Edmonton Mall, Edmonton, Alta.</h4>
            <img src="West_Edmonton_Shopping_Center.jpg">
            <button>Although the “West Ed” relinquished the title of world's largest mall back in 2004, this place is still a must-visit spot for serious shoppers, with some 800 stores and services spread across six million square feet of commercial space. It’s also a great place for those who are serious about partying, with a full-blown amusement park that includes the world’s tallest and longest indoor rollercoasters,
                 a five-acre waterpark, an ice palace, mini golf and lots of other fun attractions</button>

            <img src="byward.jpg">
            <button>Just steps from the Parliament Buildings in our nation’s capital, ByWard is one of the oldest and largest farmers markets in Canada-but it’s much more than that. Attracting as many as 50,000 shoppers on warm summer weekends, vendors line the streets around the main market building, selling everything from flowers to jewelry to Beaver Tails, while the area is also home to Canada’s oldest tavern, Ottawa’s 
                oldest church, more than 100 restaurants.</button>
        </div>

        <div class="item">
            <h4>4. The Forks, Winnipeg, Man.</h4>
            <img src="theforks.jpg">
            <button>This spot at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine rivers has served as a traditional place of commerce for Aboriginal populations for more than six millennia and, in colonial times, brought together hunters, merchants and traders, so it seems rather appropriate that it now hosts millions of fashionable Winnipeggers and visitors from across the country. Home to promenades and riverwalks. </button>

        <div class="item">

            <button>If you're looking for authentic, East Asian delicacies and wares-but want to avoid the 12-hour flight-there’s no better place to visit than the Pacific Mall, in the suburban Toronto city of Markham. The largest indoor Asian mall in North America, the Pacific houses over 450 vendors, offering everything from herbs and flowers to 
                Asian fashion, in a giant space modeled on traditional markets of the Pacific Rim</button>

            <h4>6. Old Quebec City, Quebec City, Que.</h4></h4>
            <img src="petit-champlain-quebec-city-christmas.jpg">
            <button>As far at atmosphere goes, it doesn't get any better than Old Quebec City-once you pass through its historic gates and inside the walls of one of North America’s oldest cities, you’re effectively transported to another world (and another time). Famously known as “Europe without the jetlag,” Old Quebec, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, offers Continental fashions, Inuit art, a back lane lined with picturesque.</button>
